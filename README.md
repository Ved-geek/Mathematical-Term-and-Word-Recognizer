# Mathematical-Term-and-Word-Recognizer

## Introduction:

Mathematical Term and Word Recognition constricts the speech recognition to math equations; it takes as input math formulas presented in the form of user speech and produces the equations in digital mathematical form. The smaller dictionary and the specific grammar structure of the math equations help restrict the problem of the recognition process. The program has room for smartly guessing words based on the grammar structure and thus resulting in a lower error rate and better recognition.

## Problem Statement:

Allow the users to convert mathematical words, phrases and terms speech into machine language. The system should automatically recognize mathematical words, phrases and equations from the speech waves. This can be much more convenient than typing each terms and converting into machine readable format which require lots of time and efforts.

## Objective:

Earlier there were speech to text converter which were converting the pronounced words from speech into machine language which were not able to correctly recognize the mathematical equations, later there came the mathematical equation recognizer but the accuracy was too less. The Main objective of our project is to recognize word, phrases and mathematical equations in machine readable format i.e. text with good accuracy, along with this it will able to solve the recognized mathematical equations.

## Scope:

-Word, Phrases, Sentences Recognition system.

-Mathematical equations, formulae, symbols Recognition system.

-We give option to user switch between normal recognition and Math recognition system.

-We built Graphical User Interface for users with basic Menu options. 

-We also provide options to save a documents in various formats like .txt, .pdf, .docx, etc.

-In GUI we will give basic formatting options to the user for their convenience.
